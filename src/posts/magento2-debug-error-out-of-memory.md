#### Error Detail

In Magento 2, the root cause of an `out of memory` error can vary, but the Magento system typically displays a message similar to:

```
Allowed memory size of 792723456 bytes exhausted
```

#### Root Causes

Common scenarios that lead to this error include:

- **Loading large data sets** Querying a product collection without applying filters or limits can consume excessive memory.
- **Dumping or printing class objects** Using functions like `print_r()` or `var_dump()` on entire class objects instead of primitive data types (e.g., strings, numbers) can overwhelm memory, as many PHP objects are complex and bulky.
- **Model loading within loops** Loading models inside loops (`foreach`, `for`, `while`) is a poor practice. Each iteration triggers a fresh MySQL connection, model data loading, and possibly plugin or events, which quickly exhaust system resources.
- **Infinite or oversized loops** Loops with always-true conditions or massive ranges can lead to uncontrolled memory usage.

#### Debugging and Tracking the Error

Since `out of memory` errors stem from PHP configuration and runtime behavior, Magento does not pinpoint the exact class or file in the error message. Instead, it displays a generic message like the one above.

To aid debugging, consider tracing the class that often triggers this error:

```
vendor/magento/framework/Model/ResourceModel/Db/VersionControl/Snapshot.php function registerSnapshot
```

> **Tip:** Monitor memory usage and set realistic limits in your `php.ini` configuration to catch excessive allocations early.
