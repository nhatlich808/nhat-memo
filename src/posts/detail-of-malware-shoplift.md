#### Details of the Shoplift Malware

The Shoplift malware has been identified as a serious threat to both Magento and WordPress platforms by [Sucuri](https://blog.sucuri.net/2024/04/magento-shoplift-ecommerce-malware-targets-both-wordpress-magento-cms.html).

Based on my experience with Magento 2 projects, the behavior of this malware typically follows these patterns:

- It targets **online payment** flows, where users are required to enter their credit card information.
- It injects a fake payment form that closely resembles legitimate ones, often displaying trusted bank logos and titles to deceive users.
- When users enter their card information and submit the order, their data is secretly sent to an external server â€” commonly to a URI like ` <host>/health-check.php `.

The easiest way to detect Shoplift malware is by scanning the website using [Sucuri SiteCheck](https://sitecheck.sucuri.net/).

Additionally, site owners can manually review the checkout page to identify any unauthorized or suspicious credit card forms.

#### How to Protect Your Site Against Shoplift Malware

To reduce the risk of infection, follow these best practices:

- **Secure Admin Access** Since the malware can be injected via CMS or configuration changes, make sure to:
    - Frequently update admin user passwords.
    - Disable unused or inactive admin accounts.
- **Secure Server Access** As malicious code can be introduced via server access:
    - Regularly change SSH passwords.
    - Remove or disable inactive SSH user accounts.
- **Restrict External Connections** Because stolen card data is transmitted to external hosts:
    - Block unnecessary outgoing connections from your site.
    - Only allow outbound traffic to known, trusted services (e.g., payment gateways, API endpoints, etc.).
- **Routine Malware Scanning**:
    - Perform frequent security scans using Sucuri SiteCheck to detect vulnerabilities early.
